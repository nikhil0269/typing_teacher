Flutes may be open at one or both ends. Open-ended such as the concert one and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired. The instrument may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number.
