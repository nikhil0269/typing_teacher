Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Eat your own dog food. You always find something in the last place you look. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. You must not run after two hares at the same time. The heart sees farther than the head. If you're in a hole, stop digging. A lie can be halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on.
