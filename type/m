Don't judge a man until you have walked a mile in his boots. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If you buy quality, you only cry once. All cats love fish but hate to get their paws wet. The child is father to the man and to the woman. Counsel is no command. Common sense is not so common. A man is known by the company he keeps. Dogs wags their tails, not as much to you as to your bread.
